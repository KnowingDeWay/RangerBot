ranger help:

!rgr conf: Access commands such as conf addreqrg, conf editrg, conf deleterg to configure the required role groups for the bot.

!rgr help: Display this help menu.

!rgr viewreqrg: Shows all required role groups for this server.

!rgr leaveguild: Instructs the bot to leave the guild. This is prefferable over a kick/ban since this allows the bot to leave
		 without the use of punitive action which would allow the bot to leave without being recorded in your moderator
		 log or without it being permanently barred from your server.
